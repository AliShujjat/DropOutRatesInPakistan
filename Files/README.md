Edu.csv is the orginal raw copy of the data before any preprocessing. It should be noted that many of the values are missing and column headings are shortened according to the tables given in Education_dataset_meaning_2018.pdf

## Edu Version 1

Also renamed 'Gender  ' to 'Gender'

## Edu Version 2
Top 30 feature selected numeric attributes, this is to be used for the classifcations models and subsequent analysis.

## Edu Version 3
Top 30 feature selected attributes, subsetted from the original dataset, this is to be used for exploratory data analysis. 

## Edu Version 4
Since Edu3 contained null values, we performed preprocessing to deal with them. This version contains the top 35 feature selected attributes from the original dataset, this is to be used for exploratory data analysis and the Tableau dashboard.
