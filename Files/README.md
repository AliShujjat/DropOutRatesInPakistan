This is to help keep track of all versions of the original csv file throughout the course of this project.

All subsequent versions are labeled with version number, e.g Edu1.csv & Edu2.csv for versions 1 and 2 respectively 

## Edu
Edu.csv is the orginal raw copy of the data before any preprocessing. It should be noted that many of the values are missing and column headings are shortened according to the tables given in Education_dataset_meaning_2018.pdf

## Edu Version 1
This is the first version of the data. Preprocessing has been completed
