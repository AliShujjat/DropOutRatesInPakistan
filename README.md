# Drop-out Rates in Pakistan

According to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2018, Pakistan has one of the world's highest school drop-out rates, for reasons including, but not limited to gender disparity, poverty and a lack of good academic facilities. The dataset was comprehensive and was collected by visiting local schools and conducting one-on-one assessments with 260,186 children.

In this project, we aimed to analyse this dataset to explore the determinants and reasons behind the low enrollment and high dropout rates in Pakistan's rural areas.

We have compiled our findings and presented them as a dashboard, along with a report that can be found at https://alishujjat.github.io/website/
